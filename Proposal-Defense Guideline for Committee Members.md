Dear Prof./Dr. Lastname,
I hope this message finds you well. I am Firstname Lastname, a student pursuing Master's/PhD in Computer Science at the University of Windsor, [Canada], with a specialization in the Artificial Intelligence Stream, under the supervision of Dr. Hossein Fani. I am writing this message to kindly request your assistance as an internal reader for my MSc/PhD thesis proposal.
My thesis centers on [4-5 sentences about the contributions]. We have also contributed Z (http://github.com/fani-lab/z), a toolkit to support the reproducibility of our research.
Our early results have been accepted at the W conference/journal (https://doi.org/***), and I am in the process of preparing a resource paper for SIGIR24 and a journal manuscript by the end of the Fall 2023 semester.
I would be honoured to extend an invitation to you as the internal reader of my thesis/dissertation evaluation committee, given your expertise in neural models and deep learning. Attached, you will find the published paper for your reading.
I am planning to schedule the thesis proposal in early September, and the thesis defence in early January, and I would greatly appreciate hearing about your interest and availability.
Sincerely,
Firstname Lastname
MSc/PhD Student

Dear X,
We appreciate your [quick reply] and acceptance of the invitation, and we are excited to have you in the evaluation committee member.

```

6- Timing 
Send date-time options, as wide/many as possible (you can use [`doodle`](https://doodle.com/en/)), to agree on a date-time spot for all committee members, considering `10 DAYS DELAY` by the graduate secretary of the school, like:

```
Dear X,
I sincerely appreciate your willingness to join my committee.

To coordinate our meeting, I've found several time slots on September 14th and 15th, each spanning from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm.
Please kindly inform me of your preferred availability within these windows for both days.

Also, if none of these time slots suit your schedule, please do not hesitate to inform me, and I will gladly work to propose alternative options.

Sincerely,
```

When agreed on the date-time slot, there are two forms (one pdf and one word document) to be submitted to the graduate secretary;

**Word Document:** First one should be completed after the agreement on the time with your name, abstract and general info about the proposal. You should send this form to the secretary by attaching the confirmation emails on the timing from your supervisor, internal reader, and external reader.

# Defence
 
1- Preparation
 
- It is the student’s responsibility to check the Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) Important Dates for defense deadlines and allow sufficient time for the completion of the thesis finished draft, review process by the advisor, review process by the committee, the defense seminar announcement, and completion of any required changes after the defense and before the final deposit deadlines. 
- Students must be registered for the term in COMP 8970 and have applied to graduate (See FGS Important Dates).

  - After consulting with Hossein, contact your committee members one by one to inquire about their availability during your proposed defense date. Ideally, you should start with the member who has the busiest schedule. With a sample as follows:
```
Dear Dr. X,
 
I hope this message finds you well.
 
I am reaching out to inquire about your availability during the first two weeks of January 2024. I am currently in the process of planning the defense of my thesis and am aiming to schedule it within this timeframe. Understanding your busy schedule, I wanted to coordinate with you first as a valued member of my thesis committee.
I would greatly appreciate it if you could share any potential dates and times that would suit you during this period.
 
I look forward to your response and thank you in advance for your time and consideration.
 
Regards,
Your Name, Lastname

- Only after the advisor approves the draft can it be circulated to the rest of the thesis committee.
  -  Do the same procedure for all committee members, find an overlap between their availabilites, and finalize it with Hossein.
  -  Don't forget to CC Hossein
- A defense chair must be confirmed before the announcement is submitted. You may inquire with the Defense chair if they would like a copy of your thesis - they might or might not want a copy *discuss this with your advisor.
  - After finalizing the proposed date/dates for the defence, prepare a list of suggested chairs and go over it with Hossein. After making the choice, you can send an email as follows with your suggested date/time:

```
Dear Dr.X,
 
I hope this email finds you well.
 
Please find attached MSc Thesis Defense Request Form to this email in order to secure the time spot from the department of Computer Science. Based on the availabilities that you kindly provided, we suggest January 11th, 1 pm.

3- CS Graduate Secretary
 
- Provide the CS Graduate Secretary (csgradinfo@uwindsor.ca): 
-  The completed announcement template.  Must specify the complete   committee names including defense chair, title, abstract, and whether the thesis is AI related (confirmed by advisor in the thesis defense request form) – see attached templates

- After a successful defense seminar, students must complete all changes requested by the committee.  
- Bring 2 copies of the Approval Page (signature page) of your thesis and a black pen in case the committee will sign the form then. The advisor may keep the form until confirmation that all changes have been made. Or, the committee may request to see all changes before signing the form individually. This is dependent on the advisor and committee preferences.
- If Major changes – the chair of the defense will record all major changes and a report is to be submitted to the FGS and the SCS Graduate Office (csgradinfo@uwindsor.ca). The committee instructions must be completed by the student, which may include a repeat of the defense. 
- The Thesis Defense chair is to complete the grade report form and submit it to the CS grad secretary.
- Once all the changes are completed by the student, the committee upon confirming the final changes would sign the thesis approval page. 
- The student completes the final thesis deposit with the Faculty of Graduate Studies: Final Submission – Deposit Steps.
- The Thesis Defense Request form must be either physically or digitally signed (NO computer font initials are accepted) by all members of the committee (including the advisor). The advisor must also indicate if the thesis topic is AI related or not. 
- If any committee member cannot digitally sign the form, an email attachment from them confirming that your thesis is ready to proceed for defense is acceptable. These confirmations should be pasted to a word document, converted to pdf, and added with the announcement as a second pdf.    
- A reminder: the "Program Chair section" is for the Graduate Coordinator to sign, not the Chair of the Defense.  The CS Grad Secretary will forward the form to the Graduate Coordinator to review/sign once a completed form is submitted to csgradinfo@uwindsor.ca
